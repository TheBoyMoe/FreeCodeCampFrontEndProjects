                    <p>Born on July 20, 1919, in Auckland, New Zealand, he and Tibetan climber Tenzing Norgay
                        were the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest on 29 May 1953. Hillary later participated
                        in expeditions to the South Pole and was among the first to reach the top of Mount Herschel.</p>
                    <p>Hillary was also an explorer, adventurer and philathropist.  He reached the South Pole by tractor
                        on January 4, 1958, as leader of the New Zealand division of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic
                        Expedition. He was among the first to scale Mount Herschel in the Antarctic expedition of 1967.</p>
                    <p>In 1968, Hillary traversed the wild rivers of Nepal on a jetboat. He did the same up the Ganges,
                        from its mouth to its source in the Himalayas, in 1977. In 1985, Hillary and astronaut
                        Neil Armstrong flew a small twin-engine plane to the North Pole, making Hillary the first person
                        to stand at both poles and the summit of Everest</p>
                    <p>Devoted to helping the Sherpa people, Hillary founded the Himalayan Trust, which built schools,
                        hospitals and transportation hubs in Nepal. Hillary wrote that he was proud that he and his
                        team just didn't go in and tell the Nepalese what they needed: "We always responded to the
                        wishes of the local people." He served as New Zealand's high commissioner to Nepal, as well as
                        India and Bangladesh, from 1985 to 1988, and was made an honorary citizen of Nepal in 2003, on
                        the 50th anniversary of reaching the summit.</p>
                    <p>Sir Edmund Hillary died on January 11, 2008. His death being recognised with a state funeral.</p>
